I grew up in [Jericho, Vermont](http://www.jerichovt.gov/), graduated from [SUNY New Paltz](http://www.newpaltz.edu/) in Economics, and, in late 2009, married Ruolin (Sarah) Cui in Boston, Massachusetts.

In 2012, we moved to New York from DC, where we had been working as consultants. For the first several years in New York, I worked as a Data Scientist at the securities class action firm [Labaton Sucharow](http://labaton.com/) where I developed custom applications and created models and algorithms to look for corporate malfeasance.

Today, I work as a Data Science Product Manager for [JP Morgan Chase & Co](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) where I prototype products and then work with a scrum team to get them operationalized. For prototyping, the tools I work with most frequently are [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), [Teradata](http://www.teradata.com/?LangType=1033), and [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/). The machine learning techniques I work with most frequently are Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

I frequently help friends and family with their side programming / data mining projects, so feel free to reach out to me if you have an interesting project you would like help with. I am a member of [the New York Python Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/), and an eager learner of Haskell.
